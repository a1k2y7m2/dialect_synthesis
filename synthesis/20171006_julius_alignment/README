This is a script to align audio and monophone.


perl segment_julius_with_monophone.pl base.scp wav lab/ out

   base.scp ... filelist of basename
   wav ... dir to find wav file
   lab ... dir to find monophone file
   out ... dir to save aligned file

if you have:
   base.scp
      a01
   wav/a01.wav ... audio file (16kHz sampling, WAV format)
   lab/a01.lab ... monophone file,
then the following file will be generated:
   out/a01.lab
      0.000 0.500 a
      0.500 1.234 r
      ...
